The dataset includes details on the ticket booking alternatives available through the website "Easemytrip" for flights between India's top 6 metro areas. The cleaned dataset contains 11 characteristics and 300261 datapoints. Data was gathered in two stages: for business class tickets and for economy class tickets. The site provided a total of 300261 unique flight booking possibilities. 50 days of data were gathered, from February 11 to March 31 of 2022.
